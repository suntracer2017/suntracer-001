Unclouded by habit or bias
The faintest of notions
A Shimmering Horizon 
Unlike before
Like before

Too far being gone
Too far gone
Being far too gone
Far to gone
Could be just right

Beyond farewell
Farewell to silence
A silent farewell
Unfinished daydreams
Under heavenly skies
Undivided days
Secret illusions
Undiscovered days

In later light
In the late light
In a later light
The later light
A later light

Slightly grey
A little more grey
